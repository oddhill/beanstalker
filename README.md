# Beanstalker
Automatically creates deployments environments for Beanstalk repositories.

This probably won't work out of the box for anyone but Odd Hill, since it somewhat relies on our environment and folder structures. But please feel free to fork or whatever in order to get some inspiration.

# Usage
Copy app/client.js.default to app/client.js and app/db.js.default to app/db.js. Edit the files in order to supply the appropriate credentials.
